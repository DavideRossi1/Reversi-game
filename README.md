# Reversi-game
This repo was made for the "Software Development Methods" exam at the University of Trieste that I took during my studies in Data Science and Scientific Computing.

The project consists in implementing a game, practicing Continuous integration and using automated tests and Test Driven Development to grow the code.


## TODO List 

- [ ] Define the tests for TTD
  - [x] test the board 
    - [ ] **TODO**: add a test to be shure that the board is able to flip lines in more than one direction if it's necessary 
  - [ ] Test the aspects related to player: 
    - [ ] Is the program handling correctly a human player?
    - [ ] Is the program handling correctly the computer player?
  - [x] test the mechanics of the game  
- [ ] Implement the base game in terminal
  - [x] Define the rules
  - [x] Define the board
  - [ ] Define the player and the computer mechanics
  - [ ] Check the end of the game
  - [x] Check the validity of the moves
  - [ ] Update the score ad each move (and print maybe?)
- [ ] **_IMPORTANT_**: Since I had some external libraries, I had to check credits and licenses for them.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement the game in a GUI
